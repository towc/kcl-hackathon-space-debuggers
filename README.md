# space debuggers

The Year is 2020 and computers control everything. An evil AI takes over all computers. You must defeat the AI by debugging all of his bug minions or modern society will perish.

# back story

During a short hackathon, together with [leafbomb](http://leafbomb.com) & co, we created a short minigame. It was mainly for fun: no good practices were used and the game breaks quite easily, but it does bring back some memories :)

# demo

currently, you can play the game at http://leafbomb.com/game
